# Airline-vs-Vehicle-Fatalities

**Intro** - This project was based on a fake scenario where there had recently been backlash from the media on recent airline deaths stating that flying by airplanes were more dangerous than vehicles. Visualizations were used to help show to media and the airline company the data behind these claims. 

**Tools** - Excel, Tableau

**Data** - Please see the Excel and CSV file in the repository

**Methods/Evaluation/Techniques** - Distributions, Visualizations

**Conclusion** - In conclusion, you are much more likely to be in a fatal car crash compared to flying in an airplane. Fatal car crashes occur over 20x more than airplanes. The media was incorrect with their statements and should worry more about driving home than the recent airplane crashes.
